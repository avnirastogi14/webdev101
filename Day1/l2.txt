Tags and Structure of HTML

- HTML (hyper text markup language):
    two types of Tags
        - self closing Tags
            -> eg: Meta Tag
        - pair Tags
            -> had both opening and closing Tags
            -> eg: </title> pair
                - removing one (closing or starting, takes off the pair, entirely)


# The title Tag
-> not just title
-> the title on the tabs.
    (dynamic) // static for 1 webpage, but changes with change in webpage 
    (used by search engines)
    (describes the content of the page) 

## Meta Tag
-> meta data
-> the know how and description of the webpage.
* imp tag set 

# The body tag
-> content on the webpage is stored within the body tag.
